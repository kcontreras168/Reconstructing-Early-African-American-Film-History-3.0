Charlene Regester poses questions about prevailing racial politics, on-screen and off-screen identities, and black stardom and white stardom. She reveals how these women fought for their roles as well as what they compromised (or didn't compromise).

By the onset of the Depression, the Black population had become primarily urban, transforming individual lives as well as urban experience and culture. The text probes into the relationship of place and time, showing how urban settings became an intrinsic element of African American film as Black people became more firmly rooted in urban spaces and more visible as historical and political subjects. Illuminating the intersections of film, history, politics, and urban discourse, it considers the chief genres of African American and Hollywood narrative film: the black cast musicals of the 1920s and the ""race"" films of the early sound era to blaxploitation and the hood films as well as the work of Spike Lee toward the end of the 20th century.","2003","2016-04-14 21:31:04","2016-04-14 21:31:04","","","","","","","","Black city cinema","","","","","Temple University Press","Philadelphia","English","","","","","Open WorldCat","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although blackface performance came to be denounced as purely racist mockery, and shamefacedly erased from most modern accounts of American cultural history, Strausbaugh shows that, nevertheless, its impact has been deep and longlasting. Strausbaugh illuminates truths about race rarely discussed in public, including: --American culture conforms neither to knee-jerk racism nor to political correctness. It is neither Black nor White nor Other, but a mix. --No history is best forgotten--however uncomfortable it may be to remember. The power of blackface to enrage and mortify Americans to this day is reason enough to examine what it still tells us about our culture and ourselves. --Blackface is still alive. Its impact and derivations--including Black performers in ""whiteface""--Can be seen all around us.--From publisher description.","2006","2016-04-14 21:32:41","2016-04-14 21:32:41","","","370","","","","","Black like you","","","","","Jeremy P.

In fact 'Roll Along' is supposed to be a colored comedy. Cotton fields, dancing on the levee, Rastus and Sam fighting each other over the hand of Mandy, the steamboat race up the Mississippi river and the cotton field combine to make good entertainment.

I am of the opinion that this same comedy put over by clever Race artists would be more successful.""</p>","/Users/karlacontreras/Library/Application Support/Zotero/Profiles/v1v2wix2.default/zotero/storage/685S6T2C/THOMAS - 1923 - Motion Picture News.pdf","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Tony Langston's Movie and Stage Department","","","",""
